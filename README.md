# TurnipCollector
**_Hear ya, hear ya! Get your Turnips sold fast and easy!_**

This bot is designed to scour through the acturnips subreddit to find any posts related to selling/buying.
## Requirements
 You will need a Reddit account as well as little bit of Karma to bypass the Rate-of-comment Limit. 


## Features

- Bot copies other peoples comments -> gets around questions like "Whats your favourite Villager"
- Bot doesn't copy the AutoModerator (would be pretty obvious lol)
  - print out: 
    > "Bot chosen"
- Bot doesn't spam, waits a semi-random amount of time after each comment
  - print out:
    > "Waiting X seconds"
- If no comments exists, bot posts a random, pre-written Line. 
  - print out: 
    > "Random Line X"
- Constant scanning of new submissions for set keywords


## Clearing a few things up
This bot can only post on a Reddit submission, so the author notices you. Actually taking the spot in the line is your task.

Thats it! Happy Hunting
